\section{Introduction}

\subsection{Project Overview}

Electric vehicles are becoming more and more popular as people look for sustainable transportation options. With so much data available about EV registrations, it's important to have good tools to visualize and understand this information. That's what our project is about.

We built an interactive web-based dashboard that visualizes electric vehicle registration data from Washington State. The dashboard allows users to explore the data through different types of charts and discover patterns in EV adoption.

\subsection{Objectives}

The main goals of this project were:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Create a dashboard with multiple visualization types using D3.js
    \item Implement interactive features like filtering and cross-filtering
    \item Apply data visualization concepts learned in the course
    \item Make the data easy to explore and understand
    \item Find meaningful insights about EV adoption trends
\end{itemize}

\subsection{What We Built}

Our dashboard includes:
\begin{itemize}
    \item 9 different chart types (bar, donut, treemap, line, stacked bar, scatter, map, grouped bar, bubble)
    \item Cross-filtering feature where clicking one chart filters all other charts
    \item Real-time filtering with search, year sliders, and checkboxes
    \item Interactive map with zoom and pan
    \item Dynamic insights panel that updates based on selections
    \item Export functionality to download filtered data
\end{itemize}

% 4. Visualizations
\section{Visualizations}

We implemented 9 different visualization types. Each one shows a different aspect of the EV data.

\subsection{Bar Chart - Manufacturer Distribution}

The bar chart displays the top 15 manufacturers by number of registered vehicles. This gives an immediate view of which brands dominate the EV market.

\textbf{Key Feature:} Clicking on any bar triggers cross-filtering, which updates all other charts to show only that manufacturer's data.

\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.85\textwidth]{barchart.png}
    \caption{Bar Chart showing EV distribution by manufacturer}
\end{figure}

\textbf{Insight:} Tesla leads with 44\% market share, significantly ahead of other manufacturers.

\newpage

\subsection{Donut Chart - Vehicle Type Distribution}

The donut chart shows the split between Battery Electric Vehicles (BEV) and Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEV). The center displays the total count.

\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.85\textwidth]{donutchart.png}
    \caption{Donut Chart showing BEV vs PHEV distribution}
\end{figure}

\textbf{Insight:} About 75\% of registered vehicles are fully electric (BEV), while 25\% are plug-in hybrids (PHEV).

\subsection{Treemap - Model Market Share}

The treemap provides a hierarchical view where rectangle sizes represent the number of vehicles. Larger rectangles indicate more popular models.

\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.85\textwidth]{treemap.png}
    \caption{Treemap showing market share by model}
\end{figure}

\textbf{Insight:} Tesla Model 3 is the most popular single model with over 2,000 registrations (21.43\% of total).

\newpage

\subsection{Line Chart - Adoption Trends}

The line chart tracks how EV registrations have changed over time for different manufacturers. Each colored line represents a different brand.

\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.85\textwidth]{linechart.png}
    \caption{Line Chart showing adoption trends over time}
\end{figure}

\textbf{Insight:} Tesla's growth accelerated significantly starting around 2018, while other manufacturers show more gradual increases.

\subsection{Stacked Bar Chart - EV Type Trends by Year}

The stacked bar chart shows BEV and PHEV counts stacked on top of each other for each year. This reveals both the total growth and how the mix has changed.

\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.85\textwidth]{stackedbar.png}
    \caption{Stacked Bar Chart showing BEV vs PHEV by year}
\end{figure}

\textbf{Insight:} BEV registrations have grown much faster than PHEV in recent years, showing a clear market preference for fully electric vehicles.

\newpage

\subsection{Scatter Plot - Range Evolution}

The scatter plot displays how the average electric range has improved over time. Points are connected to show the trend clearly.

\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.85\textwidth]{scatterplot.png}
    \caption{Scatter Plot showing electric range improvement over time}
\end{figure}

\textbf{Insight:} Average electric range has improved from about 70 miles in 2011 to over 200 miles in recent years - nearly a 3x improvement.

\subsection{Geographic Map}

The map shows where EVs are registered across Washington State. Circle sizes indicate the number of vehicles in each city.

\textbf{Features:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Zoom in/out with mouse wheel or buttons
    \item Drag to pan around the map
    \item Reset button to return to default view
    \item Hover for city details
\end{itemize}

\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.85\textwidth]{map.png}
    \caption{Geographic Map showing EV distribution across Washington State}
\end{figure}

\textbf{Insight:} EV registrations are heavily concentrated in urban areas, especially the Seattle metropolitan region.

\newpage

\subsection{Grouped Bar Chart - BEV vs PHEV Comparison}

The grouped bar chart places BEV and PHEV bars side by side for each year, making direct comparison easy.

\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.85\textwidth]{groupedbar.png}
    \caption{Grouped Bar Chart comparing BEV and PHEV by year}
\end{figure}

\textbf{Insight:} In 2023, BEV registrations massively outpaced PHEV, showing the market's strong shift toward fully electric vehicles.

\subsection{Bubble Chart - Brand Performance Matrix}

The bubble chart encodes three dimensions of data in one visualization:
\begin{itemize}
    \item X-axis: Average model year (newer brands on the right)
    \item Y-axis: Average electric range
    \item Bubble size: Number of vehicles registered
\end{itemize}

\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.85\textwidth]{bubblechart.png}
    \caption{Bubble Chart showing brand performance matrix}
\end{figure}

\textbf{Insight:} Tesla has the largest bubble (most vehicles) positioned in the upper-right quadrant, indicating newer models with higher range.

\newpage

% 5. Interactive Features
\section{Interactive Features}

\subsection{Cross-Filtering (Brushing and Linking)}

This is one of the key features of our dashboard. When a user clicks on a bar in the manufacturer chart, all other visualizations instantly update to show only that manufacturer's data.

For example, clicking on ``TESLA'' will:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Update the donut chart to show only Tesla's BEV/PHEV split
    \item Filter the treemap to show only Tesla models
    \item Adjust the line chart to highlight Tesla's trend
    \item Show only Tesla locations on the map
    \item Recalculate all the insights for Tesla only
\end{itemize}

This technique is called ``brushing and linking'' and it allows users to explore any manufacturer's complete profile across all visualizations.

\subsection{Real-Time Filtering}

The sidebar provides several filter controls:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Manufacturer Search:} A dropdown with autocomplete that lists all 27 manufacturers. Users can type to search or scroll to select.
    \item \textbf{Year Range Sliders:} Two sliders to set the start and end year (2010-2024). Charts update as you drag.
    \item \textbf{Vehicle Type Checkboxes:} Toggle to show or hide BEV and PHEV vehicles.
\end{itemize}

All filters update the visualizations in real-time without needing to click a button.

\subsection{Interactive Tooltips}

Every chart element has a tooltip that appears on hover. Tooltips show:
\begin{itemize}
    \item The data value
    \item Percentage of total (where applicable)
    \item Additional context like model names or years
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Dynamic Insights Panel}

The sidebar shows key statistics that automatically update based on current filters:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Top manufacturer
    \item BEV vs PHEV percentage
    \item Average and maximum electric range
    \item Peak registration year
    \item Top city
    \item Year-over-year growth rate
\end{itemize}
